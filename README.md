# Advanced Bash Automation for Web Developers


This is the GitHub repo to accompany the Egghead Course "Advanced Bash Automation for Web Developers". Watch it on egghead.io here: [https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-bash-automation-for-web-developers](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-bash-automation-for-web-developers).

This course was created as a follow-up to my "Automate Daily Development Tasks with Bash" course (repository: https://github.com/ccnokes/automate-daily-development-tasks-with-bash, videos: https://egghead.io/courses/automate-daily-development-tasks-with-bash)

Each lesson's contents are in their respective folder.

This course is focused on macOS. Much of it applies to Linux systems as well, but note that sometimes commands or their options are different on Linux.
